This project is a machine learning model that classifies drugs based on their toxicity using a machine learning algorithm called graph attention networks.

The above files contains the dataset (from Toxcast invitrodb 4.2), the final model, and the initial baseline model.

Due to the size limits for Github uploads, all of the results are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15uzPWTv1vfebAmRkEQqbCDXodHWHLoH9?usp=sharing
